* the pair_chain design implies there should be memory issues 
	because the containers will go out of scope and thus be freed 
	after each recursion depth, which means that any pair_chain pointers
	are automatically invalidated.
	(this does not appear to be the case for some reason, investigate)


* binsert is probably wrong , because the number of comparisons seems
	to be more than necessary
